## Important Note

This repository contains a collection of Signal Processing exercises programmed in MATLAB. 
The exercises range from basic tutorials,  graphing impulse responses, and up to generating audio signal from speech.


## Signal Processing

Signal processing is an area of systems engineering, electrical engineering and applied mathematics that deals with operations on or analysis of signals, or measurements of time-varying or spatially varying physical quantities. Signals of interest can include sound, electromagnetic radiation, images, and sensor data, for example biological data such as electrocardiograms, control system signals, telecommunication transmission signals, and many others.
